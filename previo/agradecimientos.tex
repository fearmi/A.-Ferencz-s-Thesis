\section*{Acknowledgement}
First and foremost, to my advisors Dr-Ing. Renato Rímolo Donadio and M.Sc. Sergio Arriola-Valverde, without them this project would have never happened; their support and guidance were crucial for the completion of this work. I thank them for their confidence in my abilities over these years.

To my tutor Ph.D. Héctor Garcia de Marina Peinado for all the support given to me during the time we worked alongside and guiding and teaching me during this period.

To Adam Seewald, Elzbieta Pastucha and all the staff at SDU UAS Center, who always tried to make me feel part of them. For that, I am very grateful and hope we can see each other somewhere in the future again.

To Yoel Merenstein and Isaac Rochwerger, for the friendships and patient you had for the duration of my studies. 

To my friends: José Enrique Hernández, Senpai Francisco Acuña, Alejandro Nevares, Johan Arrieta, Marco Oviedo, Melissa Fonseca, Dayhana Sanchez, thank you for making these years a thrill ride.  I won’t change the laughs, stress, and fun we’ve had throughout these years. 

To Sole, I would have probably never made it, without you and your unconditional support, Thanks for being a powerful force in my life, you’ve made me a better person all around. This is for you.

Finally, to my family. I would have never been able to achieve all my goals through my academic years.
