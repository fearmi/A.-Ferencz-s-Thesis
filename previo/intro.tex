\section{Introduction}
Photogrammetry is a technique with utility in very diverse applications such as agriculture,
forestry, topography, an inspection of structures, among many others. This technique allows making geo-referenced three-dimensional maps from a series of photographs of the
area under study.\cite{Articulo}. To carry out a photogrammetric survey, it is necessary to take
Photographs with a certain overlap that completely covers the terrain to be analyzed. Also, it is essential to gather data of the time, position and orientation of each of the photographs for further processing, which will lead to photogrammetric products. The implementation of this technique with unmanned aerial systems (UAS) represents a low-cost solution, simple and with high resolution compared to other alternatives as is the use of manned aircraft and satellites.\cite{FotogrametryThesis}

Currently in the photogrammetry laboratory (UASTEC) of the School of Electronic Engineering of the Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC) Is investigated the use of photogrammetric techniques with UAS systems for various applications. The Lab has several multirotor platforms that have great maneuverability and agility. However, due to the high power consumption associated with the multiples engines, autonomy is severely punished.\cite{Leonardo}. In the past years, the lab has been exploring the use of fixed-wing UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) for photogrammetric purposes. The graduation project of Ing  Edgar Guiterrez accomplished the first step in this process, by developing a Fixed-wing UAV for photogrammetric use.\cite{Edgar}

Unlike multi-rotor platforms, fixed-wing systems are characterized by having a more straightforward electronic system, so its energy consumption is lower. Its physical structure ensures an aerodynamic
more efficient, which allows them to achieve high flight speeds and therefore a cover more area. Together these two properties profile fixed-wing systems as one alternative for large-scale analysis.

With the help of Ph.D. Héctor Garcia de Marina Peinado, and  his team at the SDU UAS center, this project aims to develop a methodology to allow the end user to design and follow a flight path with an open source fixed-wing UAV to gather the necessary data to create photogrammetric products. The methodology must have the capability of computing the parameters required to ensure an optimized design to meet the photogrammetric product requirements.

 \textit{\textbf{Document structure}}
In chapter 2 we briefly introduce the basic terminology used in the report and the concept of UAS, its components, and basic functionality to have a better understanding of the expected behavior.

Chapter 3 will briefly describe the principles and workflow of computer vision. Also in the section is an introduction to JeVois camera and capabilities.

Chapter 4 define terms relative to mission planning, then creates a relationship between the term using a mathematical equation — the chapter finish with an explanation of the surveying routine executed in the flights.

Chapter 5 starts with a general description of the methodology, stating the inputs, outputs of the modules that compose the workflow. Next, in this chapter, there is an insight into each module explaining each sub-block of the module.

Chapter 6 is where the validation of the proposed methodology takes place.
