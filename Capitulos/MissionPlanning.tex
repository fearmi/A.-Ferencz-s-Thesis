\section{Mission Planning}
For UAV, autonomy is characterized by its level of interaction with the operator: the more abstract the operator decisions are, the more autonomous the vehicle is. Mission planning and flight scheduling, computing an appropriate path for the vehicle to achieve the objectives of the mission, are several of the challenges that face UAV development to increase the autonomy level. Usually, mission planning is used to describe all these tasks.\cite{4281723}

The first step in the design is to decide the scales or resolution as well as the required accuracy. Once those two requirements are known, the following processes follow:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Planning aerial photography (developing the flight plan);
\item Planning the ground controls;
\item Selecting software, instruments and procedures necessary to produce the final products
\end{enumerate}
For the flight plan, the planner needs to know the following information, some of which are computed.\cite{Design_plann}
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of end lap and side lap.
\item Flying height.
\item Focal length of the camera lens.
\item Size of the CCD.
\item Size of CCD Array (how many pixels).
\item Size and shape of the area to be photographed.
\item Ground speed of UAV.
\end{itemize}.

\subsection{Front and side overlap}
When an area is covered by vertical aerial photography, the photographs are usually taken along a series of parallel passes, called \textit{flight strips}. As shown in figure \ref{fig:EndLap}, the photographs are normally exposed in such way that the area covered by each successive photograph along a flight strip, duplicates or overlaps part of the ground of previous photo. This lapping along the flight strip is called \textit{end lap}, and the area coverage common to an adjacent pair of photographs in a flight strip is called the \textit{stereoscopic overlap area}. The overlapping pair of photo is called \textit{stereopair}.\cite{elements_photogrammetry} \cite{Sergio}

\label{fig:EndLap}
\end{figure}
Adjacent flight strips area  are photographed so that there is also a lateral overlapping of ground coverage between strips. This condition shown in figure \ref{fig:SideLap}, is called \textit{side lap}\cite{elements_photogrammetry}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Flying height computation}
The flight height H that is need to obtain a given ground sampling distance (GSD: is the distance between pixel centers measured on the ground) can be computed and depends on the camera focal length, the camera sensor width  (mm), and the image width (pixels).\cite{GSDComputation}

\caption{GSD variable definition}
\end{table}
based on the fact that:
\begin{equation}
H/F_{R} = D_{w}/S_{w}
\end{equation}
The flight height H is given by:
\begin{equation}
H = (D_{W}\cdot F_{R})/S_{W}
\label{H}
\end{equation}
The distance covered on the ground by one image in the width direction (foot print width) is given by:
\begin{equation}
D_{w}=(imW*GSD)/100
\label{DW}
\end{equation}
\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Height equation Variable definition}
\end{table}
Combining equations \ref{H} and \ref{DW}, the flight height is given by:
\begin{equation}
H[m]=(imW\cdot GSD \cdot F_{R})\cdot (S_{w}*100)
\end{equation}
Image shotting rate to achieve a given overlap depends on the speed of the UAS, the GSD and the pixel resolution of the camera.

Form figure \ref{fig:velocity}, we obtain the following equations:
\begin{equation}
od =overlap\cdot D
\label{od}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x=D\cdot od
\label{x}

t = x/v
\label{t}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D=D_{h}=(imH\cdot GSD)/100
\label{D}
\end{equation}
Combining equations \ref{od} and \ref{D} into equation we obtain \ref{x}:
\begin{equation}
x = D_{h}-overlap\cdot D_{h}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x= D_{h\cdot (1-overlap)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x = ((imH\cdot GSD)/100)\cdot (1-overlap)
\label{X_large}
\end{equation}
Combing the equations \ref{t} and \ref{X_large}:
\begin{equation}
t=x/v=\frac{((imH\cdot GSD)/100)\cdot (1-overlap)}{v}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Flight path design}
To minize the amount flight strips and turns, when working in rectangular shape area, it is best to use the smallest dimension of project area to layout the flight strips. In Figure \ref{fig:line_orientaion}, the red lines with arrowheads represent flight lines or strips, while the black dash lines represent the project boundary.

\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{imagenes/Fligth_path.png}
\caption{Correct flight lines orientation}
\label{fig:line_orientaion}
\end{figure}
when using a digital camera with a rectangular shape CCD array,it is best to chose the largest dimension of the CCD array to be perpendicular to the flight direction. In Figure \ref{fig:camera_orientaion}, the blue rectangles represent images as taken by a camera with rectangular CCD array. The wider dimension of the array is always configured to be perpendicular to the flight direction\cite{GCP}

\label{Amount of flight line equation variable definition}
\end{table}
The procedure to compute the number of flight lines as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the coverage on the ground of one image using equation \ref{D}
\item Compute the flight lines spacing as follows:
\begin{equation}
SP = D\cdot \frac{(100-SL)}{100}
\end{equation}
\item Number of flight lines (NFL) is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
NFL=\frac{width}{SP}+1
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Poly survey}
The poly survey is a navigation routine that the UAV follows to survey the area of any convex polygon given an entry point, the number of waypoints which define the polygon, the sweep width and the desired orientation of the sweeps.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{imagenes/Convex_polygon.png}
\caption{Example of a poly survey convex polygon}
\label{fig:Convex_poly}
\end{figure}
The entry point is the first corner of the polygon and the point at which the UAV will begin surveying the area, as shown in figure \ref{fig:Convex_poly} the first waypoint is  \textit{S1} . When at the entry state, the UAV circles the entry point to smoothly transition into the first sweep. The UAV keeps circling the entry point until it gets to the waypoint altitude. After finishing the first sweep, the direction of the next sweep is determined by the distance of the entry point to the edges of the polygon. If there is more area above the first sweep, the UAV sweeps up. If there is more area below the first sweep, the UAV sweeps down.\cite{Poly_survey}

The UAV keeps sweeping back and forth until it reaches the end of the polygon. At this point, the UAV sweeps back up and down the polygon halfway in between the sweeps previously made by the UAV. 
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{imagenes/FSM.png}
\caption{Poly survey Finite state machine }
\label{fig:FSM}
\end{figure}

The poly survey algorithm is a multistage finite state machine consisting of five different stages: Entry, Seg, Turn, Ret and Turn 2.
\subsubsection{Entry}
The first task to perform is to compute the value of space between lines, numbers of lines and distance between photos, utilizing the equation stated above. Having these values, the algorithms guide the UAV to a circle a point near the entry waypoint until it reaches the desired altitude and speed. As seen in the image \ref{fig:entry_stage}, The plane is climbing while flying in a circle near the entry waypoint \textit{S1}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{imagenes/Entry.png}
\caption{Simulation of the poly survey, entry stage}
\label{fig:entry_stage}
\end{figure}
If the altitude, position, and orientation of the plane are correct, the FSM changes to \textit{Seg}. Before the transition to Seg, the camera starts taking photos with the distance interval that was computed earlier.
\subsubsection{Seg}
\textit{Seg} is the state where the plane surveys the area under study. The UAV follows a straight line taking photos until it reaches the end of the segment. At that point, the UAV automatically stops taking photos and saves them on to the memory of the camera and transition to Turn 1.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{imagenes/SEG.png}
\caption{Simulation of the poly survey, SEG stage}
\label{fig:SEG_stage}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:SEG_stage} the plane is following a straight segment while taking photos. Figure \ref{fig:Photos}, shows a simulation of the photos taken by the camera.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{imagenes/Photos.png}
\caption{Photo capturing process simulation}
\label{fig:Photos}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Turn 1}
In \textit{Turn 1} the UAV fly's in a circle until it reaches the return angel, that its the opposite of the sweeping angle. This behavior is made to have the proper space between lines. Once the UAV is in the correct orientation, the FSM changes to the RET stage.
\subsubsection{RET}
\textit{RET} stage takes the UAV from one side of the convex polygon to the other to continue with the sweeping. Once the UAV reached the end of the polygon, the FSM changes to Turn 2.
\subsubsection{Turn 2}
In \textit{Turn 2} the UAV fly in a circle until it reaches the sweeping angles. At that point the FSM transitions to SEG.

Figure \ref{fig:FSM_example} helps to understand the finite stage machine behavior and transition.  The green lines are the SEG, stage where the UAV is sweeping the area and taking photos.  The red segments are turned 1 stage where the plane circles back to continue the sweeping. The black lines represent the RET where the UAV fly from one edge of the polygon to the other, and light green lines area the turn 2 stage, where the plane aliens with the polygon to start another sweep
