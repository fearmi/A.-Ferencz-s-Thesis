\textbf{Theoretical computations}

The mission consists of surveying study area B with a 0-degree angle (South to North), and area A with a 180-degree angle (North-South). Using the equation from the Flight planning chapter with the parameters of tables. It is possible to compute the following (Front overlap and side overlap for both missions are 80\% , and GSD of 3.5 cm/pixel). Table \ref{Table: Valores} show the computed values:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

Parameter                 & Field A & Field B \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Value computation for flight planning}

\end{table}
\textbf{Camera adjustment}\newline
A python program controls JeVois camera, the only setting that can be changed is the resolution of the image. In these study the resolution is 1280 x 1024 pixel, autofocus is turned off, due to the lack of shutter in the camera it is not possible to control the shutter speeds.

\footnote{In this study, the control point and landmark placement is not executed due to lack of proper equipment} 
\textbf{Flight path and mission simulation}\newline
The simulation of the mission is executed on the Paparazzi Ground Control Station (GCS). Compiling the mission code in NPS mode, it is possible to estimate the plane behavior and path. Figure \ref{fig:bsim} shows the simulation of Field B surveying mission.

\subsection{System integration}
As mention before the payload for this mission is a JeVois smart camera. JeVois smart camera is capable of compiling and executing python and C++ programs. The camera is interfaced with the Apogee autopilot using the UART port and run on a python program.
 When the UAV is in the correct position, the autopilot sends a command to the camera to take a picture, also in this message the GPS position and attitude is sent to be saved in a data log. 

A 3D printed base was designed to be able to fix the camera to the UAV frame; it was necessary to cut two rails in the structure to slide the base in and take advantage of the existing mount. Figure n shows the 3D base. Figure \ref{fig:base} shows the JeVois mounted on the base.

This section presents an analysis of the data gathered on the surveying test mission executed on the Odense model airfield
\subsection{Mission execution}
This subsection presents an analysis emphasizing on the study of flight precision characteristics such as flight height, flight path, side, and front overlap. 
\subsubsection{Flight path}
Using the data logging capabilities of the Apogee, its possible to reconstruct the path traveled by the UAV.
Figure \ref{fig:SimVReal} shows a side by side comparison of the simulation and the real path flown by the UAV. The deviation on the flight its caused by the wind. The effect of the wind on the aircraft capability to follow the design path can have a significant impact on the success of the mission, especially since the fixed-wing UAV cannot hover or fly backward.

Using the geolocation of each picture is possible to recreate the UAV path. Figure \ref{fig:FielB} shows a line plot of the position of each photo.

\caption{ Flight path line plot for surveying mission of field B}
\label{fig:FielB}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Front and side overlap}
When designing surveying mission flight path, two of the main criteria used are side and front overlap, these together with GSD are use to compute the distance between photos and distances between strips. These distances are the input for the navigation algorithm in charged of the navigation.
\subsubsection{Front overlap}
The front overlap is closely related to the distance between consecutive photos in the same path strip.  Using the geolocation of each photography is possible to find the distance traveled by the UAV between each picture. The spacing between the images should be 7.2 m, taking into consideration the error associated with GPS measurements of +- 4m.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Result of front overlap test}
\label{Table:FrontOverlap} 
\end{table}
\subsubsection{Side overlap}
The side overlap is closely related to the distance between of pictures on consecutive strips. plotting path flown by the UAV against the error signal of the GVF algorithm, it possible to determine the deviation  error in meters of the UAV trajectory to the designed trajectories. Figure \ref{fig:errorsignalGVF} show the before mentiond plot.

By analyzing the data of the GVF error signal during the surveying segment, it is possible to evaluate the accuracy of the trajectory of the UAV during the mission. Table \ref{Table:errorGVF} shows the GVF error signal trends during the surveying segments.

Analyzing the data obtained from the software, is notable the error associated with the photogrammetric product are important. Although all the images were aligned, this process was not done correctly. Figure n shows an example of the error made by the alignment algorithm. 

There are several factors to take into consideration to explain the reasons for this behavior: the most important one: the Around 95 \% of pictures present \textit{vignetting}. Vignetting refers to the phenomenon of brightness attenuation away from the image center, and is an artifact that is prevalent in photography. Although not objectionable to the average viewer, it can significantly impair computer vision algorithms that rely on precise intensity data to analyze a scene. Applications in which vignetting distortions can be particularly damaging include photometric methods such as shape from shading, appearance-based techniques such as object recognition, and image mosaicing.  Figure \ref{fig:vignetting} shows a picture with vignetting.\cite{4663074}
